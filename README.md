# Generative AI Poetry Generator
This repository contains a Generative AI Poetry Generator capable of creating unique poems based on given starting and ending lines. Leveraging state-of-the-art techniques in generative AI, this tool produces poetic compositions that exhibit creativity and originality.

## Introduction
Generative AI is a field of artificial intelligence focused on creating outputs that mimic human-like creativity and intelligence. This project specifically explores generative AI in the domain of poetry generation. By providing starting and ending lines as input, the model generates poems that bridge the gap between the provided lines, resulting in cohesive and expressive literary works.

## Features
**Poem Generation**: Input starting and ending lines to generate a poem connecting the provided lines.</br>
**Customizable Length**: Control the length of the generated poem.</br>
**High-Quality Outputs**: Benefit from the advanced capabilities of generative AI to produce rich and coherent poetry.</br>
**Easy-to-Use Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for generating poems effortlessly.</br>

## Requirements
Python (>=3.6)<br/>
Transformers library<br/>
PyTorch<br/>
NumPy<br/>

## Getting Started
Installation: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
Dependencies: Install the necessary dependencies by running pip install transformers torch.
Run the Script: Execute the provided Python script (generate_poem.py) to generate poems.
Input Starting and Ending Lines: Enter your desired starting and ending lines when prompted.
View Generated Poem: Once generated, view the poem created by the AI in the console.

## Example
**Enter starting line**: In the meadows of spring<br/>
**Enter ending line**: Beneath the moon's soft glow<br/>
**Generated Poem:**<br/>
In the meadows of spring, where blossoms bloom,<br/>
